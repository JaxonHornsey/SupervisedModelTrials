# Supervised Model Trials

This repository stores the trials runs for each model.

Four supervised models (K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Multi-layer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machine) were tested on a classification dataset provided by UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, the dataset consisted of 8124 Instances and 22 Attributes. The purpose of our tests was to determine the best prediction accuracy and speeds between our models and for this, we also needed to find our best hyperparameters. 


The code for this project was written in the jupyter-notebook environment and coded in Python. Multiple Python libraries were also used for this project such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The scikit-learn library has standard functions for the implementation of each of our 4 models. As well as a grid search cross-validation method that allows us to find the best hyper parameters.
